Umbrella
========

Context
-------

Weather is one of the most important factors that influence our mood and daily activities. We have all faced situations where we don't know what to do, or where we can't do what we had planned due to weather conditions. That's why we created Umbrella.

Project Objectives
------------------

Umbrella is a web application that will allow users to plan their activities based on weather forecasts. Our goal is to provide a smooth and enjoyable user experience while helping people make the most of their free time.

Features
--------

Umbrella is equipped with the following features:

-   Homepage: Upon arriving at the site, users can search for their city to access current and future weather forecasts.
-   Weather Forecasts: We use the OpenWeatherMap API to provide detailed information on weather conditions in each city.
-   Recommended Activities: Based on weather forecasts, we suggest activities suitable for each situation. For example, if it's raining, we can recommend museums or cinemas, while if it's sunny, we can recommend parks or sports fields.

Team
----

We are a team of two passionate developers working together to create a user-friendly and useful web application for all users.

Deadlines
---------

We have 10 days each to complete this project, which gives us enough time to design, develop, and test all features.

Technologies Used
-----------------

Umbrella is developed using the following technologies:

-   Front-end: DaisyUI (Tailwind CSS)
-   Back-end: PHP for efficient data and query management.
-   Database: PostgreSQL to store information on recommended activities.
-   API: OpenWeatherMap to provide accurate and real-time weather forecasts.
